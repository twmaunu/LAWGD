# SVGD as a kernelized Wasserstein gradient flow of the chi-squared divergence

This repository is the official implementation of [SVGD as a kernelized Wasserstein gradient flow of the chi-squared divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02509), and in particular for the Laplacian Adjusted Wasserstein Gradient Descent (LAWGD) algorithm. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

The code is proof of concept, and therefore the code and details are given within the jupyter notebook "LAWGD.ipynb".
